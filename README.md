This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: attempting to delete a pointer to a stack-allocated variable.  The code in `bug.cpp` illustrates this mistake, resulting in undefined behavior. The corrected code in `bugSolution.cpp` shows the correct way to manage memory allocation and deallocation.
